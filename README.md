# prompt_engineering
## Overview
This project explores the application of prompt engineering techniques for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. By carefully crafting prompts, users can guide the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses across various tasks and domains.
